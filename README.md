# The project was made in hurry and is completly dirty - maby someday i'll have some time to clean it up :)

unlock-me is a puzzle game made which I made as a birthday gift for my fiancee. It's a PWA written in Angular. I've tried to apply as many non-obvious solutions as possible, i.e.
* _RelaxComponent_ uses device orientation to determine if it's stable for a period of time, then transmits the secret code using phone vibration.
* _DeadlyWavesComponent_ puzzle is solved by turning the phone offline (damn you, 5G!)
* _EgyptComponent_  wants the user to connect the phone to the charger (the plot tells you to put it on the altar - inductive charger :) )
